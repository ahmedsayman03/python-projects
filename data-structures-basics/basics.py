"""Data:
        clear, understandable definition
        single concept (atomic)
        map to data element
        unambiguous

Data object: object with data

Data TYPE: classify data
e.g. int, string

int = 1, 2, 3, 4... values
string = 'abcd' etc ... values

int: 1 + 1 = 2... operations!

So,  data has values and operations

Two types of data:
1) Built in
2) Derived

Built-in
    langauge supports
    int, bool, . (decimal / float), str

Derived
    implementation in many ways, but still type of data

    Combination of 1) built in data and 2) operations on them

    e.g. list [1, 2, a, 3]
    1, a is a combination of data

    list.append()
    ^ operation on them

    Array, Stack, Queue


Basic OPERATIONS:
    DS -> data -> data processed by ops

    choose DS by what ops need to frequently be used on the DS

    traverse / travel through it
    search
    insert
    delete
    sort, rearrange
    combine, merge"""
