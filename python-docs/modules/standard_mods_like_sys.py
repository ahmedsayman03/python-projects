def std_mods():
    """Explains standard modules in Python Library Reference (such as sys, not core to language but built in)."""

    # Python has a library of standard modules called Python Library Reference

    # Some modules are built into the interpreter (operations like sys calls)
    # Not core to the language, but built it

    # E.g. sys module
    # sys.ps1
    # sys.ps2
    # Are the prompts. These variables are available in interactive mode. They are the following, respectively:
    # >>>
    # ...

    # The variable
    # sys.path
    # is a list of strings. Interpreter searches path for modules.
    # Taken from environment variables PYTHONPATH

    # Can be changed like so:
    # import sys
    # sys.path.append('/a/b/c')
